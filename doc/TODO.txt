- Make ``xmlhelper.Transformer._append_to`` a static method.

- Deal with comments and processing instructions. This is only partly
  done by now. ``count_characters`` and ``get_text`` work correctly.

- Documentation: So far you can create an HTML documentation with
  epydoc.

- insert_at() does not give a useful error message, when you try to
  insert something at an index position greater than the respective
  string length. But it returns a defined error value which might be
  even better.

- A more efficient implementation of ``cut`` is desperately needed
  as we use far too many xpath expressions.
  
- Maybe a function that inserts an element at the very end of the
  content of a given tag (either at the end of the text, if the
  element has no children, or at the end of the tail of the last
  child element).
