*************************
Changelog for XMLservices
*************************

0.20.0
======

Strip namespace part from tagname.

0.19.1
======

Allow transformation of root element to a list of serializable
elements. This allows transformations to text instead of XML.

Bugfix: FollowingNodesIterator did not raise ``StopIteration`` when
``next`` was called repeatedly.

0.19.0
======

Turned ``xmlhelper.Transformer._append_to`` into a static method,
which might be better for reuse.

Also ``xmlherlper.Transformer._append_to`` now returns the given
target object. This makes writing some simple transformations
more convenient.

Default transformation first tries to call a method called
``_convert_`` followed by the local part of the tagname of the
given element. This helps avoid multiple ``elif`` statements.

0.18.0
======

Let two elements switch their places. Tails stay where they are.

Check if one element contains another.

0.17.1
======

Bugfix: If multiple (> 3) strings occurred in a row in ``_flatten``,
some elements were skipped.

FollowingNodesIterator.

``index_iter``: iterates over document, adds ``xml:id`` to index and
yields element for further processing.

``__eq__`` and ``__hash__`` for ``TextNode``.

``skip_nodes``.

Better namespace handling in Transformer.

Better list handling in Transformer.

0.17.0
======

Added TextNode.

Be more flexible with appending lists in Transformer.

0.16.0
======

Added basic infrastructure for transformations (``xmlhelper.Transformer``).

0.15.7
======

Made the module compatible with Python 2 and 3.

Added requirement ``lxml`` to ``setup.py``.

0.15.6
======

Namespaces dict cleaned, added two more namespaces from the MS Office
realm.

0.15.5
======

Added some documentation.

Added test for ``PrecedingIterator``.

Added ``verbose`` option for doctests.

Rewrite of ``get_t_struct`` as generator.

Code cleanup and additional tests to get better
coverage values. Coverage is now 99%. The only
thing missing is proper testing of ``goto_next_char``.

0.15.4
======

MGH and dMGH namespaces.

0.15.3
======

Yet even more namespaces (Microsoft Office).

0.15.2
======

Some more namespaces.

0.15.1
======

Addition of some namespaces.

0.15.0
======

New: Started a namespace dictionary with the most commonly used
namespaces.

New: Added an Indenter that does some pretty printing (experimental).

0.14.1
======

Bugfix: ``lstrip`` did not work properly (issues with ``skip_els``
and with looping over subelements). As ``strip`` calls ``lstrip``,
it was affected, too.

0.14.0
======

Added FollowingIterator to loop over following axis of given element.

0.13.1
======

Bugfix: ``split`` did not place the tail of the parent properly.

0.13.0
======

``lstrip`` and ``strip``

0.12.0
======

Delete attribute.

0.11.0
======

complete rewrite of the notoriously problematic ``goto`` function
(The old implementation is still available, called ``goto2`` for the time being,
but this is not part of the API.)

0.10.0
======

Implemented ``get_xpath_index`` and ``get_xpath``.

0.9.0
=====

Implemented ``split``.

0.8.0
=====

Create ``copy`` of elements. 

0.7.1
=====

``span`` also accepts one element, wraps a ``span`` around given element

0.7.0
=====

New feature: ``span``.

0.6.0
=====

New features: ``wrap``, ``collect``, ``cut_element``.

0.5.1
=====

Added some required metadata.
Corrected error in MANIFEST.in.

0.5.0
=====

New features: ``move_element``, ``move_element_to_pos``, and
``move_element_to_textpos``.

0.4.1
=====

Implemented ``skip_els`` for ``rstrip``.

Minor adjustments in doctests.

0.4.0
=====

Re-implemented ``goto`` from scratch and re-enabled ``insert_at``.

0.3.0
=====

New feature: ``rstrip(el)``

Temporarily removed the faulty ``goto`` (and as a consequence
of this temporarily removed ``insert_at``).

0.2.0
=====

New feature: ``cut(from_el, to_el)``

0.1.1
=====
